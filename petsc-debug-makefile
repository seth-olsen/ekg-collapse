# "make" uses the following implicit rule to compile
# a .c file into a .o file:
#
#       $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) <the-.c-file>
#
# or to compile a .cpp file into a .o file:
# 
#       $(CXX) -c $(CXXFLAGS) <the-.c-file>
#
# and the following implicit rule for linking:
#
#       $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) <all-dependent-.o-files> $(LDLIBS)
#
# (regardless of whether .o files from C++ or C source) 
# which means the above commands are inserted automatically by
# compiler if no commands given after "target : dependency"
# (note that commands signalled by tab)
#
# file.o implicitly takes file.cpp (or .c) as a dependency,
# so it is inserted by the compiler if not given explicitly
# 
# "make" uses the following rules to decide what to run:
#
#    If you type make and there's a file called makefile,
# it  runs the commands from first target of that file,
# provided dependent files are more recent than target.
#    If you type make and there's a file called Makefile,
# but none called makefile, it runs the commands from first
# target of that file, provided dependent files are more
# recent than target.
#    If you type make -f <filename>  it runs the commands
# from the first target of <filename>, provided dependent files
# are more recent than target.
#    If you type make <target> it looks for a file called
# makefile (then Makefile) and locates the target. 
#
# In all cases it will also run commands for targets that
# are dependencies of the first or given target.
